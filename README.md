# UBC Courses
A command line tool to quickly search for courses, course seat availabilty and other course details. The program also provides the option to lookup professors on ratemyprofessors.com and includes commands to automate building new worklists or adding to existing worklists. All in all, this is a much faster way of looking up details of particular courses compared to going to the website. Built as a personal exploration to web scraping as well as the `python` programming lanuage.
